## Tick-Tock Tick-Tock Tick-Tock...

I recently came to an important conclusion about how to best manage my time,
and I want to share the insight that I had with readers.

During my course of study at App Academy, I made remarkable progress in a
very short period of time. I was astounded that one week of study in this
high-pressure context was worth months of self study at home, where I rarely
pushed beyond comfortable limits.

One of the factors that allowed such rapid progress while at App Academy
was the direction and guidance that we received. Of course a well-planned
curriculum, and excellent lectures helped propel us forward. Yet there was
another factor to the help we received: structured plans. We did not have
to commit our time and energy to choosing what to study, or which projects
to work on. Instead, we were given specific things to work on as pair-programming
partners, or on our own. I think it is easy for students to under-appreciate
the value of this sort of planning.

After finishing the course, I knew my personal projects still needed some
work. I have continued to work on them, but now several weeks later, I am
facing a problem that I haven't dealt with since before I started App Academy.
I could do anything, and with my enhanced knowledge of frameworks such as
Ruby on Rails and React/Redux, I could do it in a variety of ways. Plus
there are a million other technologies that I want to master, and that might
help me find work soon. So I find myself spending too much time reading
about different things I could do, and bouncing from one idea to another.

As soon as I recognized this problem, I started thinking, "What can I do
to fix it?" I have adopted two new methods for dealing with the challenge
of being my own curriculum guide.

First, I started planning my goals for each day. This may seem obvious to
some, but it is not something I have really needed to do very much in the past.
Now I make it a point to write down my goals for the following day as the last
task I complete on any given day. This way, I don't have to stop and think,
"What should I do today?" or "OK, What do I want to do next." If I find myself
wanting to go off on a tangent to research a potential new technology or
something like that, I stop and write a note. Then, as I am wrapping up my
work for the day, I review those notes, and the progress that made that day,
and let all of those factors play into my plans for the following day. I try
to come up with four specific things that I plan to accomplish on the following day.

Second, I downloaded an app called Brain Focus. There are plenty of similar
apps available for Android or iOS, but actually a simple timer would do
the job just fine. The purpose of the App is to section my time into delimited
blocks. I currently have it set to 40 minute work blocks, with 5 minute breaks
in between. This app gives one longer break after finishing four work blocks.
This is not a huge change in the way I do my work, but it does really help
me stay focused. During a work block I stay focused on one goal. Then, I
can go to the bathroom or grab a coffee when I am on one of my breaks. This
prevents me from tricking myself and getting up too frequently. Too many
breaks harms my progress both by eating into work time, and forcing me to
refill my working memory with relevant details and peripherals to get back
into a project or activity.
