## Hustle is an Acquired Skill

There is so much to learn and so little time. For newcomers into any community
it is often difficult to determine what is the most important thing to learn
next. I have definitely been up against this recently.

Right now I am at a Dev Ops training program at the Amazon Pop-up Loft in
San Francisco. It is interesting, and I am absorbing a lot of information
about how AWS works and what services are available. I'm excited to try
putting a project up on their service just to explore and check it out.
I'm not really sure that this is the best use of my time now. I might be
better off doing a coding challenge or working on a new Rails app.
