## Crash and Learn

It’s difficult to pull myself away from my current projects, but I know I have to start putting my writing skills to use. Use it or lose it!

My life has been moving very fast, and recent times have been difficult. I moved to San Francisco with big dreams of becoming a kick-ass software engineer. I had to roll back my plans after a cycling accident on Market street.

It was a beautiful day, one week before I was meant to start App Academy on Spear Street in San Francisco’s financial district. I was cruising along on a borrowed bicycle, enjoying the sunshine, and the fact that the traffic was much tamer in San Fransisco than I was used to in Taiwan. My brother had warned me about the traffic on Market street, but it didn’t really seem to menacing compared to the busy streets of Taichung. I had also been warned to watch out for “dooring,” since that is a common way that people often get injured cycling in downtown SF. I wove around a bus only to realize that I had crossed over the streetcar tracks in the middle of the road, just outside of the bicycle lane. As I looked down, I recognized that this could be a danger to my brother’s narrow-tired road bike. I turned a sharp right to ensure a good angle against the tracks. Something went wrong. I was suddenly lying on the ground in front of the bicycle feeling lots of sharp pain.

I picked myself up and looked back at traffic. A few cars were less than two blocks behind me heading in my direction. They weren’t going super fast. The bicycle was just standing there. It hadn’t fallen over. It hadn’t moved at all. I realized the front wheel was lodged in the tracks, and attempted to pull it out. My hand hurt a lot, and I looked at it to see what was up. It was busted open and bleeding a lot. My heart sank.

I tried again to move the bicycle, but it was stuck firmly, and I had no grip. Luckily another cyclist stopped to help me out. Together, we yanked the wheel free and I swiftly pulled the bike out of the road. The helpful cyclist resumed his journey. I stared at my hand for a second, worrying about how much this injury might cost. I was blessed to encounter yet another kind stranger at that very moment. He said simply, “Can I help you?”

I said, “Yeah, I hurt my hand. I think I need some bandages or something.”

He took me into a nearby building, told the security guard that he worked there and that I needed some help. The security guard asked me if I needed an ambulance. I knew that would be expensive, and I thought if I could just bandage up my wound and get back home safely with my brother’s bicycle everything would be ok. I said, “No, I think I will be OK, but I do need some bandages.”

He asked me how I fell. I told him about the tracks in the road. He said he used to cycle around SF, and had likewise been caught in the tracks, fallen and broken his arm, and therefore quit cycling. I thought cynically, “I guess I’m lucky.”

The security guard pushed the bicycle into a corner, and asked his coworker to watch it. He got a first-aid kit and took me to a bathroom on the second floor. He pointed out that my left elbow was also bleeding profusely. As I washed off my hand and looked at it more carefully, and saw a deep gash along the inner edge of my right pinky finger. I definitely needed to see a doctor.

I figured I would bandage myself up as best I could, and cycle to the nearest health clinic. I didn’t want to make too big of a deal out of this, and I hoped it would not cost too much, but I thought my hand probably needed stitches. I started calling clinics that I found on Google Maps. I found the one with the best price. That was not a wise selection criteria.

I slowly and cautiously cycled over to Concentra Urgent Care. It was painful and unwise. It was also a lot further than in looked on the map. I arrived around 5:20 pm. They closed at 6:00. The nurse was kind, and helped clean my wounds. The doctor had shaky hands. He was clearly dismayed to have to see one more patient before he could go home. He mentioned that I could have a broken bone, but trailed off to ask the nurse if the radiologist was still there. She answered no. He had already left the office. The doctor sewed up my finger, and glued a large slab of hanging flesh back onto my elbow. He told me to come back the next day for an X-ray if my hand hurt a lot. I asked him if it would be a bad idea to ride the bicycle back across town to get home. He said that would probably be pretty painful, but he didn’t see why not. That is such horrible medical advice, it is almost laughable now. Luckily, my brother and his girlfriend came to pick me up in her car. The stitches probably would have been torn loose had I attempted to ride home over SF hills.
