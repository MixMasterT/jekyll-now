## Victory

I feel very fortunate to have had a great experience at my first hackathon.
Last weekend, I attended the NASA Space Apps Challenge in Berkley, CA.

That was my first hackathon, so I didn't really know what to expect. Luckily,
the event was pretty well run, and the hosts were very kind, and helpful.
During the opening announcements, Ted Tagami offered to help any first-time
hackathon participants or people without partners to meet the coordinators
and find a group to work with.

I followed that suggestion, and was promptly introduced to a pair of iOS
coders, Vihan Bhargava and Vishan Bharam. The coordinators assured us that
we could work together, since I know rails for a backend, and they know
iOS for a front-end. We sat down and started to discuss what we wanted to
do.

As we zeroed in on an idea, several others came and joined our team, including
Tenzin Sonam, Goerge Veung, and Miguel Juteau. We decided to try to gamify
environmentally friendly behavior, and incorporate some visualizations of
environmental problems.

The whole process was a lot of fun, and I was very impressed with the skill
and focus that my team-mates applied. I got the rails backend working, and
the front-end team did an amazing job incorporating lots of great features.

Everyone pitched in to help make the presentation strong on Sunday, and it
turns out we won the "people's choice" award. This was a great honor and
a thrilling first endeavor into a hackathon.

I think my favorite moment of the whole weekend came when I asked Vihan
if he had studied computer science in college, because I was impressed with
the breadth of his knowledge. He turned to me, and chuckled while he said,
"Dude, I'm a freshmen in highschool."

I certainly won't forget this wonderful experience.

Now it's my job to use this victory energy to help push myself as I pursue
an actual job as an engineer!

As a commitment to make this happen, I am hereby pledging to double down
on coding, and writing. This post marks my word!
