## Takikng Full Advantage

So even if no one wants to hire me as a developer, I am learning a ton while
I am here in San Francisco. This is an amazing place to be because there
is a very high concentration of tech gurus and brilliant developers.

Today I attended two events that were both very enlightening and enjoyable.

In the morning and early afternoon I went to a workshop at the AWS Pop-up
Loft, which focused on IoT (the Internet of Things) and writing skills for
Alexa. Alexa is a voice-based UI framework that AWS has been working on for
some time. Alexa works with the Echo devices and other AWS devices. You can
take advantage of a pretty sophisticated API to add skills to Alexa, so that
voice input can trigger pretty much whatever kind of response you can program
in. The sample projects that were shared with us focused on sharing trivia
information and calling out Hello World, but it was easy to see how this
framework could be used for more interesting purposes. For example, you could
write a skill that would report news, or one that would tell you the weather
forecast without much difficulty. Then, the user merely has to say, "Alexa,
tell me the weather", or whatever queue you program in (they call these
utterances), and Alexa will fetch data as programmed via a Lambda function
and then read that data out to the user.

The speaker at the event described the evolution of UI moving from punch-cards
to keyboard and mouse, then to touch-enabled devices, and now moving forward
to natural language interactions. It is easy to see why this will make
computers easier to interact with.

In the afternoon, I did an online practice interview via a new service called
Pramp. This was a great way to practice coding in a social environment. My
partner was interesting, and we both learned a lot from the experience.

Then in the evening, I attended APIs and IPAs, at Readme.io. This was a
fun event complete with Pizza and Beer in which speakers gave lightning
talks showing off some of the cool APIs they are making available to users
or customers of various types. The most polished product was probably an
app called StatX that makes data visualization easy through a ready-made
mobile app, and includes an API backend that seemed pretty easy to configure.
However, the most exciting one to me was Nick.js, which is an API building
tool that helps with writing web-scrapers. It was not too hard for me to
imagine cool ways to use that to aggregate data on club hits for DJs.


It's great to be learning so much, but I still hope I can find paying work
as a developer soon!
