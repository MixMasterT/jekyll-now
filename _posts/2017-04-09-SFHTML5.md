title: SF HTML5 Rocks!
---

## This crew is top form

I was lucky enough to make it to a great gathering at Google on Friday, the
7th. The people there were amazingly friendly, and the speakers really
delivered interesting talks. We learned about some of the possibilities
available through SVG in good'old html5 from Sarah Drasner. She strongly
recommended GreenSock as an SVG library. We also learned about the html5 sizes
property from Eric Portis. Both speakers wire interesting and informative.
The food was great, and the DJ at the end really made the event special.

I highly recommend attending SFHTML5 meetups in the future. Their next
one will be May 12th at the same location (Google 345 Spear St.).
