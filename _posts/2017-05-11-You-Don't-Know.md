title: Excellent Resource

## Wow, This Resource Rocks!

Things have been accelerating in my life recently. I have a few upcoming
interviews and opportunities that I hope will lead to a role as a software
engineer.

In order to prepare, I have been reading up on JavaScript, and I came across
an excellent free resource that I wanted to share. This resource is hosted
on Gihub, and written by Kyle Simpson (github handle: getify).

[Here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)'s a link. The series
is called 'You Don't Know JS' and it covers everything from the basics
to advanced features of JavaScript including detailed explanations of
what's going on under the hood.

I just started reading Async & Perfomance from this series, and I was very
impressed by both the quality and depth of the explanations. It's very readable,
but also accurate. That is a surprisingly difficult combination when talking
about asynchronous behavior, threading, 'processes', and the JavaScript event loop.
If you are learning JavaScript, I highly recommend reading this series.
