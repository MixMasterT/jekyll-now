I am a software developer currently living in San Francisco. I am passionate about
web development and network security. I have experience with a variety of frameworks
including React, Redux, and Rails.

### Purpose of this Site

This blog is meant to provide a narrative account of the bootcamp experience. It provides
both a storied context of my journey from professional educator to professional software
developer, and a resource for others who may want to pursue a similar career change.
