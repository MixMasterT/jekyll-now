# Startup

This blog is a vent for my personal opinions, issues, and story.
It also documents the story of a person attempting to follow the promise
of starting up a career in tech without standard background story of being
either a true-born computer genius or a CS major

## Jekyll and Jekyll Now

### Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that plays nice with github pages, creating
a very easy way to startup your blog.

### Jekyll Now
[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) is a base repository
by [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) that will help you startup
a Jekyll blog in no time.
